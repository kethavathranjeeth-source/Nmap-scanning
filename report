#Install Nmap from the official website
Purpose: Obtain a trustworthy, up-to-date Nmap binary to perform network discovery and port scanning.
What to do:
•	Go to the official Nmap site (nmap.org) and download the installer for your platform (Windows .exe installer, macOS .dmg or Homebrew, Linux packages or source).
•	On Debian/Ubuntu you can install from repositories: sudo apt update && sudo apt install nmap (but verify version vs. official site if you need the latest).
•	On Windows, run the downloaded installer and allow WinPcap/Npcap installation (required for raw packet scans).
Why it matters: Official downloads reduce risk of tampered binaries and ensure compatibility with required libraries (libpcap/Npcap).
Verification / Evidence: Include installer checksum (SHA256) from the site and the output of nmap --version after install.
Note / Caution: Only install software from trusted sources and run as needed — follow your organization’s change-control.

# Find your local IP range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)
Purpose: Determine the network(s) you are permitted to scan and the correct CIDR range to feed Nmap.
How to find it (examples):
•	Linux/macOS: ip addr show or ip a (look for inet 192.168.1.10/24) or ifconfig.
•	Windows: ipconfig and note IPv4 address and subnet mask; convert to CIDR (e.g., 255.255.255.0 → /24).
What to record: Your IP, subnet mask, gateway, and CIDR notation (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).
Why it matters: Scanning the correct CIDR avoids scanning unrelated networks and produces meaningful inventory results.
Evidence: Paste the ip a / ipconfig output in the report.

Run: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24 to perform TCP SYN scan
Purpose: Perform a fast and stealthy scan of the whole network to discover hosts and open TCP services (SYN scan, often called “half-open”).
Command explanation:
•	-sS — SYN (stealth) scan: sends SYN and waits for SYN/ACK to report open. Requires privileged access on most OSes.
•	192.168.1.0/24 — the target CIDR discovered in step 2.
Recommended safer/alternative options:
•	If not root: nmap -sT 192.168.1.0/24 (TCP connect scan).
•	Add -Pn if hosts block ICMP/host discovery: nmap -sS -Pn 192.168.1.0/24.
•	Add --reason for why Nmap classified ports: --reason.
Expected output (summary): List of live hosts and open ports per host, e.g.:
Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.10
#PORT    STATE SERVICE
22/tcp  open  ssh
80/tcp  open  http
Why it matters: Identifies reachable hosts and services you may need to inventory or secure.
Ethics & legal note: Only run scans against networks you own or have explicit permission to scan.
Note down IP addresses and open ports found
Purpose: Create an inventory of network hosts and services as the basis for vulnerability assessment or network documentation.
#What to record per host:
•	IP address and hostname (if resolved).
•	MAC address (if shown) and vendor (helps identify device type).
•	Open ports (port/protocol) and service names.
•	Service version (if -sV used).
•	Scan date/time and command used.
#Example table (for your report):
IP	Hostname	MAC	Open Ports + Service	Notes
192.168.1.10	web01	00:11:22:33:44:55	22/tcp (ssh), 80/tcp (http)	SSH open for admin
Why it matters: Organized data enables prioritized remediation and tracking over time.

 #Optionally analyze packet capture with Wireshark
Purpose: Confirm what packets are actually being sent/received during a scan and diagnose filtering, firewalls, or anomalous responses.
How to capture:
•	On Linux, run as root: sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.1.10 -w scan.pcap while running your Nmap scan.
•	Open scan.pcap in Wireshark for visual analysis.
What to look for:
•	SYN vs SYN/ACK/RST responses (distinguish open vs closed).
•	ICMP unreachable messages (indicates filtering).
•	No response (packets dropped — indicates silent filtering).
•	Retransmissions and timing (rate-limiting).
Why it matters: Packet traces provide ground truth beyond Nmap’s inference and help identify intermediate devices dropping traffic.
Evidence to include in report: Relevant packet screenshots or filter extracts (e.g., tcp.flags.syn==1 && tcp.flags.ack==1).
•	Identify potential security risks from open ports
•	Purpose: Convert scan results into actionable security findings and prioritize mitigation.
Common risk examples:
•	Open management ports (SSH/RDP) exposed to broad networks — brute-force attacks, weak credentials.
•	Web servers (80/443) running outdated software — remote code execution, remote file inclusion.
•	File sharing (SMB 445, NetBIOS 139) — sensitive shares exposed, worm propagation risk.
•	Open databases without access controls (MySQL 3306, PostgreSQL 5432) — data exfiltration risk.
How to assess severity: Consider service sensitivity, network segmentation, whether authentication is required, and known CVEs for the service/version.
Report section: For each open port, include a short risk statement and recommended mitigation (e.g., “Close port / firewall to only allow admin subnet; require key-based SSH and disable password login”).
Deliverables: Prioritized remediation list (High/Medium/Low) with suggested actions.
Save scan results as a text or HTML file
•	Purpose: Produce auditable, shareable output to include in the report and preserve evidence.
#Nmap output formats:
•	Normal text: -oN output.txt
•	XML (machine-readable): -oX output.xml
•	Grepable (legacy): -oG output.gnmap
•	All formats at once: -oA <basename> (creates .nmap, .xml, .gnmap)
•	HTML (convert XML using xsltproc or third-party tools) or use ndiff/reporting tools.
Examples:
•	sudo nmap -sS -p1-1024 -oN scan-results.txt 192.168.1.0/24
•	sudo nmap -sS -sV -oA scan-results 192.168.1.0/24
•	Why it matters: Structured outputs support automation (parsing), reporting, and storage for compliance.
Include in report: A copy of the .txt output or key excerpts, plus the exact command used and timestamp.
